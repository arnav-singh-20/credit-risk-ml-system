# Credit Risk Prediction System (ML Engineer Project)

## Overview
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning system to predict loan default risk using the German Credit dataset.

The system demonstrates ML engineering and MLOps concepts including:
- Feature engineering pipelines
- Model comparison
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Threshold optimization
- Deployment-ready artifacts

---

## Problem Statement
Banks must identify risky borrowers while minimizing financial loss.

False Negative (risky approved) is more costly than False Positive.

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Joblib

---

## Workflow

Raw Data → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Grid Search → Threshold Optimization → Deployment

---
